      <p>Gun control refers to any legal measure intended to prevent or restrict the possession or use of guns,
        particularly firearms. Nowhere in the world is gun control more controversial than in the United States, where
        possession of firearms is constitutionally protected.</p>

    <h2>Why Is Gun Control Important</h2>

      <p>In the United States, mass murders committed with guns are so frequent that the vast majority of them are not
        even mentioned in mainstream media outlets. Those that happen to be massive or heinous enough to gain national
        attention—including the murder of 49 people in an Orlando nightclub in 2016 and the massacre of 20 children and
        six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012—typically spark a short-lived and fruitless
        debate about the need for stricter gun control.</p>

    <h2>Ways To Implement Gun Control</h2>

      <li class="list">
        <ul>• Gun Buyback Programs which are short-term initiatives that provide incentives, such as money or gift
          cards, to convince people to surrender firearms to law enforcement, typically with no questions asked.</ul>
        <ul>• Provide more funding to states to improve their background check system and penalize political appointees
          at federal agencies if they don't take steps to maintain their records.</ul>
        <ul>• Restrict the sale of bump stocks, an attachment to semi-automatic weapons that can increase the rate of
          fire to more closely resemble an automatic weapon.</ul>
