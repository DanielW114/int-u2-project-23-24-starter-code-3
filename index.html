      <p>Gun control refers to any legal measure intended to prevent or restrict the possession or use of guns, particularly firearms. Nowhere in the world is gun control more controversial than in the United States, where possession of firearms is constitutionally protected.</p>

      <p>In the United States, mass murders committed with guns are so frequent that the vast majority of them are not even mentioned in mainstream media outlets. Those that happen to be massive or heinous enough to gain national attention—including the murder of 49 people in an Orlando nightclub in 2016 and the massacre of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012—typically spark a short-lived and fruitless debate about the need for stricter gun control.</p>
